# Introduction
Through the centuries people have invented unlimited variety of techniques and tools to invest money. Real estate market is probably one of the oldest. It guarantees, seemingly, a perfect tradeoff between cash, and something which allows to convert an abstract concept of money into more tangible thing – hectartes of rural plots, houses etc. However, despite the lapse of time and hundreds of years the market exists in different forms, there are no perfect answers what drives the prices of specific types of properties. Sometimes one can get an impression that the attempts to predict the housing prices, which are widely described around different media, are closer to some kind of guessing than any scientific approach. When the coronavirus pandemic in Poland and the lockdown related to it were in peak, one could read the interviews with real-estate experts who were claiming that the prices are not going to go down. For a relatively economic-concious person such statements might be confusing. How can it be that all the markets are most likely to enter a recession and, at the same time, the prices of properties would increase? There is no easy answer to that question. Sometimes, the experts might be wrong on purpose, driven by their own speculative interest. However, what is clear is that there are many determinants of property prices, having their roots in different fields. Starting from the characteristics of properties, going through the situation on financial markets and ending with their influence on investing behavior of people. In this work the first group of features is a subject of analysis. 


The main objective of this study is to find determinants of prices of apartments in Warsaw. The relation between characteristics of specific property and its value on the online-market is analyzed. 
The data obtained from Otodom.pl, which is one of the largest real-estate platforms in Poland, is combined with spatial and discrict characteristics. In this analysis multiple machine-learning methods, starting from OLS regression, through spatial-econometrics specific methods and ending with non-parametric models, are utilized. There are two main hypotheses verified in this work. 

<center><i><b> Hypothesis One </b></i></center>
<center><i> Spatial-based variables are significant predictors of housing-prices </i></center>

<center><i><b> Hypothesis Two </b></i></center>
<center><i> The coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the housing-prices </i> </center>

# Data
The dataset used in the analysis is created by the authors based on several sources. There are three general groups of variables: 

  * property characteristics 
  * spatial characteristics 
  * district characteristics. 


Property characteristics were obtained from otodom.pl website with the use of web scraping algorithm written in Python. Data sources from otodom.pl website include also the location of the property for sell. 

Spatial data used in the analysis regard distances from particular points obtained with the use of geographical coordinates. Data on coordinates of PKiN was obtained from openstreetmap.org while coordinates of subway stations were obtained from maps.google.pl. 

As to districts characteristics, the data used regard attractiveness of live conditions in particular Warsaw districts. These measures are synthetic which means they were obtained on the basis of multiple factors. We sourced it from the report prepared by the Statistical Office in Warsaw [^gus]. All the codes used for operations described above can be found on https://github.com/GIKroch/Housing-Prices-Spatial-econometrics. 

Below table presents all the variables we analyze with its detailed descriptions.

## Data preparation

This section serves a purpose for raw data preparation and manipulation. There are four main areas that it covers: proper variables formatting, variables categorization and also missing values treatment.

### Variables formatting and feature engineering
First, the initial formatting of the variables was investigated.    
   
```{r}
nums <- sapply(df_final, is.numeric)
df_final_nums <- df_final[,nums]
kable(head(df_final_nums)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "responsive")) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "90%")
```
   
```{r}
oth <- which(!nums)
df_final_oth <- df_final[,oth]
kable(head(df_final_oth)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("hover", "responsive")) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "90%")
```

For variables which are qualitative or binary, we apply factor formatting. 

```{r}
df_final$District <- as.factor(df_final$District)
df_final$Ownership <- as.factor(df_final$Ownership)
df_final$Construction_type <- as.factor(df_final$Construction_type)
df_final$Finishing_condition <- as.factor(df_final$Finishing_condition)
df_final$Property_market <- as.factor(df_final$Property_market)
df_final$Heating <- as.factor(df_final$Heating)
df_final$Vistula_side <- as.factor(df_final$Vistula_side)
```

### Features engineering

In the next stage, categorization of numerical variables takes place. We decide on the variable cuts mainly based on the relationship with the dependent variable being Price_per_sqm and also based on the splits obtained with the decision tree algorithm. 

<b> Number of floors </b>

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df_final, aes(x = No_of_floors, y = Price_per_sqm)) + 
  geom_point(color="#451A54") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
formula <- Price_per_sqm ~ No_of_floors
tree1 <- rpart(formula, data = df_final, control=rpart.control(minsplit=10, cp=0.002, maxdepth = 3))
fancyRpartPlot(tree1, palettes = "Spectral")
```

```{r}
df_final$No_of_floors_binned <- 
  ifelse(df_final$No_of_floors < 2, "<= 2", 
       ifelse(df_final$No_of_floors > 2 & df_final$No_of_floors <= 4, "> 2 & <= 4",
              ifelse(df_final$No_of_floors > 4 & df_final$No_of_floors <= 28, "> 4 & <= 28", 
                     ifelse(df_final$No_of_floors > 28, "> 28", 0))))

df_final$No_of_floors_binned <- as.factor(df_final$No_of_floors_binned)
```

<b> Construction completion year </b>
When analyzing variable indicating construction completion year, we noticed three outliers which seemed to be caused by mistyping. We also decided to create and use further in the modelling variable indicating age of the building instead of the year it was built.

```{r}
df_final$Year_built <- ifelse(df_final$Year_built==19885, 1985, df_final$Year_built)
df_final$Year_built <- ifelse(df_final$Year_built==20112, 2012, df_final$Year_built)
df_final$Year_built <- ifelse(df_final$Year_built==20110, 2010, df_final$Year_built)

df_final$Building_age <- 2020 - df_final$Year_built
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df_final, aes(x = Building_age, y = Price_per_sqm)) + 
  geom_point(color="#451A54") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
formula <- Price_per_sqm ~ Building_age
tree2 <- rpart(formula, data = df_final, control=rpart.control(minsplit=10, cp=0.002, maxdepth = 3))
fancyRpartPlot(tree2, palettes = "Spectral")
```

```{r}
df_final$Building_age_binned <- 
  ifelse(df_final$Building_age <= 0, "<= 0", 
       ifelse(df_final$Building_age > 0 & df_final$Building_age <= 12, "> 0 & <= 12",
              ifelse(df_final$Building_age > 12 & df_final$Building_age <= 64, "> 12 & <= 64", 
                     ifelse(df_final$Building_age > 64 & df_final$Building_age <= 105, "> 64 & <= 105",
                            ifelse(df_final$Building_age > 105, "> 105", 0)))))

df_final$Building_age_binned <- as.factor(df_final$Building_age_binned)
```

*Days from the initial announcement*

```{r}
df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement <- ifelse(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement=="Less than a day", 0, df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement)
df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement <- as.integer(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df_final, aes(x = Days_from_initial_announcement, y = Price_per_sqm)) + 
  geom_point(color="#451A54") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement_binned <- 
  ifelse(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement == 0, "Less than a day", 
       ifelse(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement > 0 & df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement <= 7, "Week or less than a week",
              ifelse(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement > 7 & df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement <= 30, "Month or less than a month", 
                     ifelse(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement > 30 & df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement <= 365, "Year or ess than a year",
                            ifelse(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement > 365, "Over a year", 0)))))

df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement_binned <- as.factor(df_final$Days_from_initial_announcement_binned)
```

*Floor*

```{r}
df_final$Floor <- as.factor(df_final$Floor)
levels(df_final$Floor)
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
df_final %>% group_by(Floor) %>% count
```

```{r}
df_final$Floor_binned <- df_final$Floor
levels(df_final$Floor_binned) <- c("> 10","=> 1 & <= 5","> 5 & <= 10","=> 1 & <= 5","=> 1 & <= 5","=> 1 & <= 5","=> 1 & <= 5","> 5 & <= 10","> 5 & <= 10","> 5 & <= 10","> 5 & <= 10","parter","poddasze","suterena")
levels(df_final$Floor_binned)
```

*Number of rooms*

```{r}
df_final$No_of_rooms <- as.factor(df_final$No_of_rooms)
levels(df_final$No_of_rooms)
```

```{r}
df_final %>% group_by(No_of_rooms) %>% count
```

```{r}
df_final$No_of_rooms_binned <- df_final$No_of_rooms
levels(df_final$No_of_rooms_binned) <- c("1","2","3 or more","3 or more","3 or more","3 or more","3 or more","3 or more","3 or more","3 or more")
levels(df_final$No_of_rooms_binned)
```

### Treatment of Missing values 

This section aims to missing data treatment. Below can be seen the missing values ratio for each variable. 

```{r}
colMeans(is.na(df_final))
```

For qualitative variables like form of ownership, floor, type of construction, finishing condition, heating, number of floors in the building, building age and floor, we decide to make missing values an explicit factor level.

```{r}
f_names <- c("Ownership", "Floor", "Construction_type", "Finishing_condition", "Heating", "No_of_floors_binned", "Building_age_binned", "Floor_binned")

df_final[,f_names] <- lapply(df_final[,f_names], function(x) fct_explicit_na(x, na_level = "Missing")) %>% as.data.frame
``` 

As to qualitative variables, we decided to fill the value of Rent with Predictive according to Mean Matching algorithm. Value of rent for the owned property is a concept typical for Poland and depends on many external factors like type of the entity managing the building, living area, number of people living in the property, type of heating (e.g. if urban then it is contained in the rent, if gas then it is paid separately to the gas plant). We decided to use as a proxy of these factors the living area, number of rooms and also type of heating. 

```{r results='hide'}
# formula <- make.formulas(df_final[,c("Rent","Area","No_of_rooms_binned","Heating")])
# imp <- mice(df_final[,c("Rent","Area","No_of_rooms_binned","Heating")],
#             m=5,
#             method="pmm", 
#             formulas = formula, 
#             seed=1234)
# 
# rent_imp <- rowMeans(imp[["imp"]][["Rent"]])
# names(rent_imp) <- NULL
# 
# df_final$id <- 1:dim(df_final)[1]
# miss_rent <- df_final %>% filter(is.na(Rent))
# nonmiss_rent <- df_final %>% filter(!is.na(Rent))
# nonmiss_rent$rent_imp <- NA
# 
# df_final_1 <- cbind(miss_rent, rent_imp)
# df_final_2 <- rbind(nonmiss_rent, df_final_1)
# 
# df_final_2$Rent_imp <- ifelse(is.na(df_final_2$Rent), rent_imp, df_final_2$Rent)
# df_final_2 <- df_final_2 %>% dplyr::select(id, Rent_imp)
# df_final <- left_join(df_final, df_final_2, by="id") %>% dplyr::select(-Rent_imp.x, -id) %>% dplyr::rename("Rent_imp" = Rent_imp.y)

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

After the final data has been obtained. There was a possibility to look at relations between selected variables and the districts of Warsaw. Figure 1 presents mean price per square metre of apartments in specific districts

<b>Figure 1. Mean price per square metre in specific districts of Warsaw</b>
<br>
<div class = "figure"> 
![Figure 1](C:/Users/grzeg/Desktop/studia/Data Science/2 rok/semestr 2/Spatial/Housing-Prices-Spatial-econometrics/graphs/Mean price per square metre in specific districts.PNG)\ 
</div>

Rembertów, which is an east-border district of Warsaw occured to be the cheapest one place to live in the city in mean values. At the same time, Śródmieście, being the central region, has the highest mean prices, almost 3 times as high as in Rembertów.    

<b>Figure 2. Max price per square metre in specific districts of Warsaw</b>
<br>
<div class = "figure"> 
![Figure 2](C:/Users/grzeg/Desktop/studia/Data Science/2 rok/semestr 2/Spatial/Housing-Prices-Spatial-econometrics/graphs/max price per square metre in specific districts.PNG)\ 
</div>

The same pattern as in the case of mean prices, can be spotted for max prices. Again, Rembertów is clearly the cheapest one district and Śródmieście is the most expensive. The relation between two extreme districts is even more visible. Max prices in Śródmieście are about 5 times higher than in Rembertów. 

From the analysis of mean and maximum prices a picture of Warsaw apartments market can be drawn. The prices, in general, increase to the central part of the city. Additionaly, the market is quite differentieted. One can also get an impression that the apartments located on the east side of the Vistula river are cheaper. Therefore, <b><i> Auxiliary Hypothesis One </i></b> is proposed. <br>


<center><i><b> Auxiliary Hypothesis One </b></i></center>
<center><i> The prices of the apartments located on the east side of Vistula river are, in general, cheaper </i></center> <br>


<b>Figure 3. Mean apartment square metre area in specific districts of Warsaw</b>
<br>
<div class = "figure"> 
![Figure 3](C:/Users/grzeg/Desktop/studia/Data Science/2 rok/semestr 2/Spatial/Housing-Prices-Spatial-econometrics/graphs/mean apartment square metre area in specific districts.PNG)\
</div>

Mean apartment square area is a variable which delivers an interesting view on a differentation of square metres of apartments in districts. The south districts seem to have higher means of square metres of apartments. 

<b>Figure 4. Median year of construction of the apartments in specific districts of Warsaw</b>
<br>
<div class = "figure"> 
![Figure 4](C:/Users/grzeg/Desktop/studia/Data Science/2 rok/semestr 2/Spatial/Housing-Prices-Spatial-econometrics/graphs/Median year of construction of the apartments in specific districts.PNG)\ 
</div>

Median year of construction can show how Warsaw evolved in time. The process, without suprise, escalated from the center of city - Śródmieście with apartments older than 50 years (with median threshold) to the borders of Warsaw, but not with the same speed.    

<b>Figure 5. Life quality measures in specific districts of Warsaw</b>
<br>
<div class = "figure"> 
![Figure 5](C:/Users/grzeg/Desktop/studia/Data Science/2 rok/semestr 2/Spatial/Housing-Prices-Spatial-econometrics/graphs/life quality.PNG)\ 
</div>

Life quality measures were introduced to capture the determinants of housing-prices widely present in the literature. Here, again we can spot the relation, which was identified for prices of square metres of apartments. Rembertów is the worst district in the case of presented measures and Śródmieście is on the top. Based on this observation, <b><i> Auxiliary Hypothesis Two</i></b> is introduced. <br>


<center><i><b> Auxiliary Hypothesis Two </b></i></center>
<center><i> There is a siginficant relation between prices of apartments and life quality measures in specific districts Warsaw</i> </center><br>  


# Modelling

In order to estimate housing prices, we run several models and then compare them with respect to prediction power. There are three types of models which we consider: regular OLS regression, spatial algorithms and non-parametric algorithms. 

## OLS regression


## Spatial models
